The File that is used to get a connection to the database is not included. I will include it in future releases when I figure out a better way to store private information such as passwords to the databse in a more secure way. Currently the password and username to the AWS RDS databse is stored as a String in the DBConnection class. This is not a great way to handle this right now and will be changed.
